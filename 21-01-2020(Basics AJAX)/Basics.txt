AJAX(Asynchronus JavaScript And XML)
------------------------------------
Definition: Ajax is a set of web development techniques using many web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous web applications.
*Ajax is not a Programming Language

*Ajax is not a technology but group of inter-related technologies.
AJAX technologies includes:
1)HTML/XHTML and CSS
2)DOM
3)XML or JSON
4)XMLHttpRequest
5)JavaScript

*Synchronous (Classic Web-Application Model)
A synchronous request blocks the client until operation completes i.e. browser is unresponsive.

*Asynchronous (AJAX Web-Application Model)
An asynchronous request doesn’t block the client i.e. browser is responsive. At that time, user can perform another operations also.

*XMLHttpRequest:
---------------
An object of XMLHttpRequest is used for asynchronous communication between client and server.

It performs following operations:

1)Sends data from the client in the background
2)Receives the data from the server
3)Updates the webpage without reloading it.

*AJAX Works:
------------
AJAX communicates with the server using XMLHttpRequest object.

XMLHttpRequest object plays a important role:

1)User sends a request from the UI and a javascript call goes to XMLHttpRequest object.
2)HTTP Request is sent to the server by XMLHttpRequest object.
3)Server interacts with the database using JSP, PHP, Servlet, ASP.net etc.
4)Data is retrieved.
5)Server sends XML data or JSON data to the XMLHttpRequest callback function.
6)HTML and CSS data is displayed on the browser.
